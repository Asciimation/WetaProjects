# Weta Projects

Just some of the projects I worked on and write the code for during my time at Weta Workshop doing animatronics.

These are NOT running projects. You can't get them to run in any way. They all require very custom, one-off hardware (most of which no longer exists) and may use external libraries not included here as well as copyrighted audio and other files. Those are not included here. This code is all code I wrote myself and is provided purely for interested parties to see the sort of code that was used in working animatronic devices used in the film industry.

The code is all Arduino based and was usually run on Teensy microcontrollers.

There were many other little projects, prototypes and other one off bits of code I did in my time there but these were the main projects I was involved in with code worth sharing.

Each should have it's own ReadMe with extra information. These notes were written from memory so some of the details might not be fully correct!
