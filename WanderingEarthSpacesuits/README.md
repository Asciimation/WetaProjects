# Weta Workshop - Wandering Earth Spacesuits.

This is the source code I wrote that was used in spacesuits build by Weta Workshop used in the film The Wandering Earth: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7605074/

The suits consisted of a helmet with lighting and fans inside them, backpacks and on some suits an exo skeleton. Each had various groups of LEDs that could be controlled independently for colour and brightness. Some had special functions like blinking or random flickering. One set was used as a working battery display level and some were part of custom 'gags' such as a malfunctioning spinning gear in part of the space suit.

The suit would start with default values but they also included a built in DMX receiver so all the functions, colours, flash rates, fan speeds, etc could be controlled via a DMX controller wirelessly. I also build custom Windows software in .Net to act as a custom DMX controller but that codfe isn't included here.

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and may use external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine code that was used in working animatronic devices used in the film industry.
